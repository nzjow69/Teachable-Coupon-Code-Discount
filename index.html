<p id="ember85" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Each Teachable Plan provides you with unique features and opportunities for expanding your online course-selling experience.</p>
<p id="ember86" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">So, let&rsquo;s learn more about Teachable plans in-depth, comparing all features and highlighting which plan is most suited to your requirements:</p>
<h3 id="ember87" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Basic Plan</h3>
<p id="ember88" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Teachable&rsquo;s basic package is <a class="bTAdwGKKvYMAMWcpQvYfUkUWxtNkDLxQjQZsQ " href="https://bit.ly/3OMtoJx" target="_self" data-test-app-aware-link=""><strong>$29 per month</strong></a> when invoiced annually, and it is the cheapest option, whether you want to build your own LMS system or enroll in any course or video to learn.</p>
<p id="ember89" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Not only this, but It also gives you unrestricted access to learning everything (students, courses, video, and hosting).</p>
<p id="ember90" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">This is one of the things that makes Teachable so interesting.</p>
<p id="ember91" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Detail about all Features offered under the Teachable Basic plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>5% per transaction</li>
<li>Instant payouts</li>
<li>Members-only community</li>
<li>2 admin-level users</li>
<li>Product support</li>
<li>Course creator training</li>
<li>Custom domain support</li>
<li>Coupon codes</li>
<li>Drip course content</li>
<li>Integrated email marketing</li>
<li>Third-party integrations</li>
<li>Private student community</li>
</ul>
<p id="ember93" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Thus, in my opinion, this plan is a suitable fit for any user who just wants to begin or experiment with the strength and capabilities of Teachable as a platform for learning courses as a student or creating your school with its feature-rich option that aids in the same.</p>
<p id="ember94" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">However, this plan is not advised if you want to expand your business or provide coaching because the price for each transaction is 5%.</p>
<p id="ember95" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">This, in the case of many students being enrolled, will lower your profit, and the ability to obtain course completion certification, as well as the inability to advertise your class through affiliate marketing, will have a significant influence.</p>
<p id="ember96" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph"><strong>In conclusion,</strong> the Teachable Basic Plan is only appropriate for students or teachers who wish to discover how teachable works and then choose the Pro Plan or Business Plan to expand and get all benefits.</p>
<h3 id="ember97" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Pro Plan</h3>
<p id="ember98" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Teachable&rsquo;s pro membership costs <a class="bTAdwGKKvYMAMWcpQvYfUkUWxtNkDLxQjQZsQ " href="https://bit.ly/3OMtoJx" target="_self" data-test-app-aware-link=""><strong>$99 per month</strong></a> when paid annually, and based on the features offered, this plan provides the most value for the money invested.</p>
<p id="ember99" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">With all of the features included in the basic plan, this plan additionally provides your students with a certificate for course completion and compliance.</p>
<p id="ember100" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Quizzes may also be included in your courses as part of the Professional package to make them more interesting.</p>
<p id="ember101" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Depending on the business in which you sell online courses, the ability to deliver quizzes and completion certificates may be a big benefit. Advanced reporting on your students, courses, and video is also available.</p>
<p id="ember102" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph"><strong>Features of Pro plan:</strong></p>
